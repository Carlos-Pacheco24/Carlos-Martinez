    <h1><strong>What is XML?</strong></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible<strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong>much like HTML </li>
        <li>XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong>(DTD) or an <strong>XML Schema</strong> to describe the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>The main difference between XML and HTML</strong></h2>
    <title>XML</title>
    <p><strong>XML was designed to carry data.</strong></p>
    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML.</p><p>
        XML and HTML were designed with different goals:
    </p>
    
<p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus on what data is.</p><p>
HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.
</p>


    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

    <h1><strong>XML does not DO anything</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>XML was not designed to DO anything</strong></p>

    <p>Maybe it is a little hard to understand,but XML does not DO anything XML was created to structure, store and to send information</p>
    <p>The following example is a note to otve from jani, sotred as XML:</p>
    

    <p>
        <p><note></p>
        <p><to>Tove</to></p>
        <p><from>Jani</from></p>
        <p><heading>Reminder</heading></p>
        <p><body>Don't forget me this weekend</body></p>
        <p></note></p>
    </p>

    




    <p>The note has a header and a message body. It also has sender and recelver information. But still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, recive or display it.</p>
